    <h1>The Best Books I've Read in 2022 (So Far)</h1>
    <p>At the end of last year, I set a goal to read 75 books in 2022. Accompanying my goal was a "reading resolution" to try to read at least half an hour a day. Since most of my reading takes place in spurts — i.e. I'll read five books in a row and then not read for a month – I wanted to try to make my reading more consistent. As of this writing, I am behind on my goal (thanks, grad school!) but still intend to hit 75 books by December 31.</p>

<h2>The Books</h2>
    <p>Of the books I've read so far this year, these are five of my favorites in no particular order. This year, I'm pleased to have read a greater diversity of types of books — that is, while I typically read exclusively young adult or graphic novels, I am reading much more nonfiction this year. I rated each book on a five-star scale, going to quarter stars if needed.</p>
    <p>Here are five of the best books I've read in 2022 (so far):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>The Anthropocene Reviewed: Essays on a Human-Centered Planet</em>, by John Green <b>(4.5 out of 5 stars)</b></li>
        <li><em>The Giver: The Graphic Novel</em>, adapted and illustrated by P. Craig Russell <b>(4.5 out of 5 stars)</b></li>
        <li><em>When Breath Becomes Air</em>, by Paul Kalanithi <b>(4 out of 5 stars)</b></li>
        <li><em>Loveless</em>, by Alice Oseman <b>(4.5 out of 5 stars)</b></li>
